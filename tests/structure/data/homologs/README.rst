Pairs of protein structures with structural homology
====================================================

1P4K + 4OSX: Dimer with high sequence and structure similarity
3LSJ + 3RD3: Dimer with high structural similarity but low sequence homology
2NWD + 1HML: Structure with high sequence and structure similarity
3KCS + 6OA8: Structure with high sequence and structure similarity
2NWD + 1QGI: Structure with medium structural similarity but low sequence homology
3KCS + 1GL4: Structure with medium structural similarity but low sequence homology, one of the structures has two chains
